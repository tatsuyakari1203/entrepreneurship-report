\section{Executive Summary}

\subsection{Company Overview}
CogniMind is an innovative EdTech startup founded in 2024 by four technology and business students from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). Our mission is to "empower learners by transforming the search for solutions into a journey of discovery and critical thinking." We envision becoming the leading AI learning tool in Southeast Asia.

CogniMind develops an AI-powered note-taking application specifically designed for students, with a strict focus on STEM subjects. Our unique selling proposition lies in our three-tiered learning methodology: hints → Socratic questions → complete solutions, which promotes deep understanding rather than simple answer provision.
