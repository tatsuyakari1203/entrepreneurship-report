\subsection{Market Research Data}

\subsubsection{Survey Results}
\textit{(This content is hypothetical, based on a survey of 200 students aged 16-22 in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learning Habits:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{85\%} report frequently encountering difficult exercises with no immediate help available.
        \item \textbf{70\%} admit to using problem-solving apps like PhotoMath, but \textbf{65\%} of them feel concerned about becoming dependent and not truly understanding the material.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Attitude towards AI:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{90\%} are open to using AI as a learning support tool.
        \item \textbf{75\%} express particular interest in an AI tool that can "suggest" a solution path rather than giving the answer immediately.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Willingness to Pay:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{60\%} are willing to pay a monthly fee (equivalent to 1-2 bubble tea drinks) for a truly effective learning application.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Market Size Analysis (TAM, SAM, SOM)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TAM (Total Addressable Market):} The entire e-learning market in Southeast Asia, estimated to be worth \textbf{\$15 billion} by 2028.
    \item \textbf{SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):} The segment of high school and university students (16-24 years old) in Vietnam who use smartphones and digital learning tools.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Calculation:} \textasciitilde5 million users × \$40 (average annual spending) = \textbf{\$200 million USD}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):} The market share CogniMind aims to capture in the first 3 years.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Calculation:} 500,000 paying users × \$40/year = \textbf{\$20 million USD} (equivalent to 10\% of SAM).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Specifications}

\subsubsection{System Architecture}
CogniMind is built on a Microservices architecture, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance.

    \item \textbf{Database:} \textbf{PostgreSQL} for user data and \textbf{Pinecone (Vector Database)} for the RAG system.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Development Roadmap}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 - MVP (6 months):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Core feature: Solve exercises with hints for 3 subjects: Math, Physics, Chemistry.
        \item Platform: Web App and Android application.
        \item Goal: Test the model, gather feedback from the first 10,000 users.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 - Feature Enhancement (Next 12 months):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Subject expansion: Biology, English.
        \item Launch the "AI Tutor" feature (in-depth Q\&A chatbot).
        \item Release the application on iOS.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 3 - Scale \& Expansion (Next 18 months):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop a B2B dashboard for schools.
        \item Integrate gamification features (leaderboards, rewards).
        \item Research and pilot in the Thai and Indonesian markets.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Financial Details}

\subsubsection{Unit Economics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item LTV = (Average Revenue Per User per Month × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate
        \item LTV = (\$3.5 × 80\%) / 5\% = \textbf{\$56}. \textit{(This figure is lower than the initial projection, reflecting more conservative detailed calculations)}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CAC = Total Marketing \& Sales Costs / Number of New Customers
        \item Target CAC < \textbf{\$1.5}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Funding Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pre-Seed (Completed):} \$20,000 from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology's startup incubator to build the prototype.
    \item \textbf{Seed Round (Current):} Seeking \textbf{\$500,000} to launch the product and reach 50,000 users.

\hline
\textbf{Risk Type} & \textbf{Detailed Description} & \textbf{Mitigation Strategy} \\
\hline
\textbf{Technology Risk} & AI "hallucination" providing incorrect answers, affecting credibility. & - Apply a Human-in-the-Loop mechanism to review complex answers. \newline - Allow users to report incorrect answers. \\
\hline
\textbf{Market Risk} & Users still prefer tools that provide instant answers. & - Enhance communication about the benefits of "learning to think". \newline - Provide a "quick solve" mode for simple exercises. \\
\hline
\textbf{Operational Risk} & API costs surge due to inefficient use. & - Build a smart caching system. \newline - Set spending limits and automatic alerts. \\
